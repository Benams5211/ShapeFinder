# Weekly memo – 09-07-2025

This week I implemented a playable “Shape Finder” prototype in p5.js. I built the crowd of shapes with random types, sizes, and colors, added a two-line **SHAPE / FINDER** poster that always stays inside the
rounded panel, and showed the exact target on the poster. I used simple rejection sampling to spread shapes with minimal overlap and biased the layout to the left to leave space for the poster.
I added click detection for circles, squares, and a precise barycentric test for triangles, plus a 15-second countdown and an **R** key reset. I also fixed a bug where the title could bleed past 
the rounded corner by composing the poster in an off-screen buffer and clipping to a rounded-rectangle path. Finally, I produced a lighter “intro-level” variant (RGB colors, fewer shapes) that keeps the 
same behavior.

I learned the p5.js lifecycle (`setup()` vs `draw()`), how to use `createGraphics()` to draw into an off-screen buffer, and how canvas "clipping" guarantees nothing escapes the rounded card.
I practiced measuring text (`textWidth`, `textAscent`, `textDescent`) to auto-size labels, and I now understand rejection sampling for collision-aware random placement and the barycentric point-in-triangle test 
for accurate hits. I also compared “polished” vs “intro-level” code and documented trade-offs. Next steps I’m considering are a score counter, levels (more shapes / less time), and simple SFX.
